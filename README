The script needs you to save your Twitter login credentials in your keychain or else you will get an error. To do this, tell Safari to save your login details to Keychain while you login to Twitter or you can do it manually in the keychain app by selecting ‘New password item’ and set Keychain item name as http://twitter.com and fill in your Twitter username and password in the following fields.

Installation
